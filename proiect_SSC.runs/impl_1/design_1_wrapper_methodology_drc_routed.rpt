2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -11.049 ns between design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_B_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_cat_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -13.086 ns between design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_B_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_cat_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.161 ns between design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_B_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_cat_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.322 ns between design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_B_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_cat_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.741 ns between design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_B_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_cat_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.892 ns between design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_B_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/ALU_0/U0/DIV/mantisa_cat_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btns_4bits_tri_i[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btns_4bits_tri_i[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btns_4bits_tri_i[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on leds_4bits_tri_o[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of clk_fpga_0.
Related violations: <none>
